/*

HD Wallet path structure:

Under the master key, build a series of hardened keys, representing accounts.
Under each account, build a series of hardened keys representing wallets.
Under each wallet, create a two regular keys, internalKey and externalKey.

Each wallet will use its internalKey and externalKey, collectively, genKeys, for generating new addresses.
These addresses map to an integer i under the genKeys.

The wallet is considered the owner of the genKeys, nobody else should generate new addresses
under the genKeys.

The wallet keeps a persistent record of the last used i for each of the two genKeys.

When generating a new address:

1. Increment the stored i value for the genKey.
2. Build a Bitcoin address based on the i value.
3. Check if this address has been seen on the blockchain.
4. If not, return the address.
5. If yes, increment i again until 4.
6. Optionally do a branch and bound type thing. Set i = 2^k for increasing k, until
   i isn't on blockchain, then do a binary search to find last i.
